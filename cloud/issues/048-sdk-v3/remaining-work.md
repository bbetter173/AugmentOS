## Needs Its Own Spike

These are complex enough that they should be spiked before implementation. They have open design questions that need team input.

### 1. `session.mic` — Audio Input

**What:** The input side of audio. `session.speaker` (output) is spiked. `session.mic` (input) is not.

**From the 039 API map:**

```typescript
class MicManager {
  onChunk(handler: (chunk: AudioChunk) => void): () => void
  onVoiceActivity(handler: (vad: Vad) => void): () => void
  readonly isSpeaking: boolean // from VAD
  readonly isActive: boolean // is mic streaming?
  readonly hasPermission: boolean
}
```

**What needs to be figured out:**

- How does `session.mic` interact with `session.transcription`? Transcription consumes mic audio. Are they independent subscriptions? Does subscribing to transcription implicitly activate the mic?
- Today, mic audio goes: glasses → phone → cloud (UDP) → transcription provider. For local apps, it goes: glasses → phone → on-device Whisper/Sherpa. Does the mic manager need to know about this routing?
- The current cloud has `MicrophoneManager`, `UdpAudioManager`, `AudioManager` — what's the relationship and does it need cleanup?
- Raw audio chunks vs processed audio — what format does `onChunk` deliver? PCM? What sample rate?
- Multiple apps subscribing to mic simultaneously — is this supported? (Currently yes via subscriptions, but should it be?)

### 2. `session.device` — Hardware & Device State

**What:** The 039 API map significantly redesigned this manager. Not spiked.

**From the 039 API map:**

```typescript
// Flattened from session.device.state.X to session.device.X
session.device.wifiConnected // Observable<boolean>
session.device.wifiSsid // Observable<string>
session.device.batteryLevel // Observable<number>
session.device.charging // Observable<boolean>
session.device.caseBatteryLevel // Observable<number>
session.device.connected // Observable<boolean>
session.device.modelName // Observable<string>
// ... more observables

session.device.capabilities // moved from session.capabilities
session.device.onButtonPress(handler) // moved from session.events
session.device.onHeadPosition(handler) // moved from session.events
session.device.onTouchEvent(handler) // moved from session.events
session.device.onVpsCoordinates(handler)
session.device.requestWifiSetup(ssid, pass) // moved from session-level
session.device.subscribeToGestures(gestures)
```

**What needs to be figured out:**

- The Observable pattern — the current `DeviceState` uses a custom Observable. Is this the right pattern for v3? Should we use a simpler getter + onChange callback instead?
- How does the flattening work at the type level? `session.device.batteryLevel` needs to be both a readable value AND an observable. What's the TypeScript type?
- Hardware events (button, head position, touch) — these are currently on `session.events`. Moving to `session.device` makes sense but needs the handler registration to flow through to the subscription system correctly.
- WiFi setup — the current implementation is on `AppSession` directly. Moving to `session.device` is a rename, but does the WiFi status interact with the reconnection system? (E.g., "glasses on WiFi" triggers video upload.)
- VPS coordinates — is this still a thing? Is it used?

### 3. `session.phone` — Phone Events

**What:** Sub-scoped notifications and calendar under `session.phone`.

**From the 039 API map:**

```typescript
class PhoneManager {
  readonly battery: number | null
  onBatteryUpdate(handler): () => void

  readonly notifications: {
    on(handler): () => void
    onDismissed(handler): () => void
    readonly hasPermission: boolean
  }

  readonly calendar: {
    on(handler): () => void
    readonly hasPermission: boolean
  }
}
```

**What needs to be figured out:**

- The sub-scoping pattern (`session.phone.notifications.on()`) — how does this interact with the subscription system? Is `notifications` a sub-manager with its own handler tracking?
- Phone battery vs glasses battery — `session.phone.battery` vs `session.device.batteryLevel`. Clear enough naming?
- The cloud already routes phone notifications and calendar events (issue 047 dashboard work). Does the `PhoneManager` just subscribe to the existing streams?
- Are there other phone capabilities that should be here? (e.g., phone GPS is on `session.location`, phone notifications on `session.phone.notifications` — is this the right split?)

## Doesn't Need a Full Spike — Implement from 039 API Map

These are straightforward renames/restructures that can be implemented directly from the [039 API map](../039-sdk-v3-api-surface/v2-v3-api-map.md) without a separate spike.

### 4. `session.permissions` — Centralized Permission Checks

```typescript
class PermissionsManager {
  has(permission: PermissionType): boolean
  getAll(): Record<PermissionType, boolean>
  onUpdate(handler): () => void
}
type PermissionType = "location" | "microphone" | "camera" | "notifications" | "calendar"
```

Straightforward. Individual managers expose `.hasPermission` as a getter that reads from this central store. No open design questions.

### 5. `session.location` — GPS

Already exists as `LocationManager`. Changes:

- `subscribeToStream()` → `onUpdate(handler)`
- `getLatestLocation()` → cached `lat` / `lng` / `accuracy` / `timestamp` read-only properties
- Add `hasPermission`
- Add `requestUpdate()` for one-shot
- Add `stop()`

No open design questions. The 039 map has the full API.

### 6. `session.led` — LED Control

No changes from v2. Keep as-is.

### 7. `session.storage` — Key-Value Storage

Rename from `session.simpleStorage`. Methods:

- `get(key)`, `set(key, value)`, `delete(key)`, `clear()`, `keys()`, `has(key)`, `getAll()`, `setMultiple(data)`, `flush()`

Rename `hasKey` → `has`, `getAllData` → `getAll`. No other changes.

### 8. `session.time` — Timezone Utils

New in v3. Simple stateless namespace:

```typescript
session.time.zone          // IANA timezone string
session.time.now()         // Date in user's timezone
session.time.toLocal(date) // convert UTC → user local
session.time.format(date, opts?) // Intl.DateTimeFormat wrapper
```

No open design questions. The user's timezone comes from `userSession.userTimezone` (already available).

### 9. `session.dashboard` — Dashboard Widget

```typescript
session.dashboard.showText(text: string | string[])
session.dashboard.clear()
```

Already implemented on the cloud side in issue 047. SDK just needs the two methods. No open questions.

### 10. `session.display` — Display / Text Formatting

Rename from `session.layouts`. Key additions from 039:

- `showText(text: string | string[])` — accepts pre-wrapped arrays
- `wrap(text, opts?)` — pure text formatting, returns `string[]`
- `maxLines`, `widthPx`, `profile` — device info read-only properties
- `createScrollView()` — ScrollView integration

The 039 API map §3b has the full spec including the two-layer wrapping model.

## Needs Discussion But Not a Full Spike

### 11. Route Namespacing (`/api/_mentraos/`)

The 039 map specifies moving all SDK endpoints behind `/api/_mentraos/`:

| v2 path         | v3 path                       |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `/webhook`      | `/api/_mentraos/webhook`      |
| `/tool`         | `/api/_mentraos/tool`         |
| `/health`       | `/api/_mentraos/health`       |
| `/settings`     | `/api/_mentraos/settings`     |
| `/photo-upload` | `/api/_mentraos/photo-upload` |

Legacy aliases at root paths for backward compat.

**What needs team input:** The cloud hardcodes these paths in `AppManager.ts`, `app.service.ts`, `PhotoManager.ts`, `app-settings.routes.ts`, `system-app.api.ts`. When does the cloud switch to the new paths? Same PR as SDK v3? Separate cloud PR? Can the cloud auto-detect which paths the SDK supports (via `sdkVersion`)?

### 12. `mentra` CLI Tool

We designed `mentra dev / build / publish` in the client SDK spike. Before building it:

- Is it a separate npm package (`@mentra/cli`)? Or bundled with `@mentra/sdk`?
- How does `mentra dev` discover `mentra.config.ts`?
- Does `mentra build` bundle `hermesc` or call it externally?
- Does `mentra publish` authenticate with the dev console? How?
- Is this v3.0 scope or v3.1+?

Probably v3.1+ — the CLI is for local apps which depend on the mobile runtime work. v3.0 is the cloud SDK refactor.

### 13. Open Questions from All Spikes

Each spike has open questions. These should be reviewed and decided before or during implementation:

**From spike.md (core SDK):**

- Remove `session.events` entirely in v3.0 or keep as deprecated shim?
- v3.1 shim removal timeline?
- ISO 639-1 codes in wire protocol — does cloud accept both `en` and `en-US`?
- Captions app: migrate to v3 API or keep on compat shim?

**From reconnection-architecture-spike.md:**

- Event buffering during TRANSPORT_DOWN (5s) — buffer or drop?
- Cloud restart: persist AppSessions to Redis? Or accept fresh start?
- RECONNECT retry strategy (every 1s? slight backoff?)
- userId transition plan (email → MongoDB \_id)
- Kill old sessionId format entirely?
- Subscription comparison algorithm
- v2 backport of `resurrected: true` flag

**From session-camera-spike.md:**

- Video recording TTL (24h? configurable?)
- SRT support timeline
- Photo upload path for local apps (no cloud intermediary?)
- Concurrent photo + stream operations
- Video max file size / duration limits

**From session-speaker-spike.md:**

- Audio priority model (priority levels? OS mixer? last-writer-wins?)
- Track system expansion (more than 3 tracks?)
- PCM encoding — SDK or cloud responsibility?
- `flush()` naming (too aggressive? `interrupt()`? `clear()`?)

**From session-state-spike.md:**

- Webview without active session — show stale data? "App not running" screen?
- Storage access without active session
- Grace period before "no-session" fires
- Auto-restart — SDK or OS concern?

**From client-sdk-spike.md:**

- Hermes context isolation (one instance per app or shared?)
- JSI `fetch` availability in standalone Hermes
- Hermes bytecode versioning (server vs phone mismatch)
- iOS App Store review for JS bundle execution
- Shared vs dedicated BLE connection

## Suggested Implementation Order

This is a suggestion, not a decision — the team should prioritize based on what matters most:

**Phase 1 — Core refactor (unblocks everything else):**

- `MentraSession` (renamed from AppSession)
- `Transport` interface + `WebSocketTransport`
- `MentraApp` (callback pattern)
- `AppServer` compat shim
- Message dispatch refactor (DataStreamRouter)
- `@mentra/sdk/session` entrypoint
- `sdkVersion` in CONNECTION_INIT

**Phase 2 — Managers (the bulk of the work):**

- `TranscriptionManager` (with `forLanguage(string | string[])`)
- `TranslationManager` (with `to(string | string[])`)
- `DisplayManager` (rename from layouts, add wrap/showText)
- `SpeakerManager` (rename from AudioManager, audio streaming)
- `MicManager` (new — audio input)
- `DeviceManager` (new — hardware events, WiFi, capabilities)
- `PhoneManager` (new — notifications, calendar)
- `PermissionsManager`, `LocationManager`, `StorageManager`, `TimeUtils`, `DashboardManager`
- `CameraManager` (unified streaming, photo cleanup)

**Phase 3 — Reconnection (fixes active bugs):**

- `RECONNECT` message type
- `TRANSPORT_DOWN` state (preserve AppSession)
- Subscription sync protocol (ACK includes subs, SDK compares)
- `sessionId` as UUID
- `cloudHostname` in webhooks
- Backward compat for v2 SDKs

**Phase 4 — Shared state + compat:**

- `session.state<T>` (typed shared state)
- WebSocket transport for state sync
- `useMentraState<T>()` React hook
- `LegacyEventShim` (v2 compat)
- Deprecated getters on MentraSession
- `AppSession` type alias

**Phase 5 — Polish:**

- `userId` → MongoDB `_id` migration
- Route namespacing (`/api/_mentraos/`)
- WebSocket path renames (`/ws/client`, `/ws/miniapp`)
- Dead code removal (app-to-app, old DashboardAPI, TpaServer/TpaSession)
- Bug fixes from the spike tables
- Migration guide, README, examples
- Publish `3.0.0`

**Phase 6 (v3.1) — Cleanup + advanced:**

- Remove all compat shims
- Remove legacy route aliases
- `mentra` CLI
- Video recording (when ASG client supports it)
- Audio priority system
- SRT streaming support
